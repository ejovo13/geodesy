// This module contains essential cryptographic functions
// like the SHA family of hash algorithms, CryptMT (a cryptographically
// secure prng that uses the Mersenne twister internally). Utilities
// to generate a large prime value for use with RSA encryption,
// Eventually I'd like to add basic utilities for ECC. I will
// later translate some of the higher level abstractions to Haskell to continue
// to get a feel for its unique and powerful type-system.
